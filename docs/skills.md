## Supported Agents

Skills work with any agent that supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format:

- Claude Code
- OpenAI Codex
- Cursor
- Amp
- Roo Code
- Gemini CLI
- And many more

## Why Skills?

Skills are 10-50x more token-efficient than MCP tools:

- **MCP tools**: Each API call returns full JSON, uses many tokens
- **Skills**: Agent learns commands once, uses CLI directly

## Viewing Installed Skills

```bash
# List installed skills
npx skills list

# List globally installed
npx skills list -g
```

## Skill Contents

Each skill contains:

- **Frontmatter**: Name, description, allowed tools
- **Commands**: CLI commands with examples
- **Flags**: Agent-optimized flags (`--output json`, `--compact`, etc.)
- **Exit codes**: For error handling
- **Workflows**: Common task patterns

Example skill structure:
```yaml
---
name: linear-list
description: List and get Linear issues...
allowed-tools: Bash
---

# List/Get Issues

\`\`\`bash
linear i list --output json
\`\`\`
```
